              Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), if
              you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EA”), we
              process your personal information under the following lawful
              bases:
            </p>
            <h3 className="!text-white">Your consent;</h3>
            <p>The performance of the contract between you and the Site;</p>
            <p>Compliance with our legal obligations;</p>
            <p>To protect your vital interests;</p>

            <p>
              If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to
              processing based solely on automated decision making (which
              includes profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect
              on you or otherwise significantly affects you.

              We do not engage in fully automated decision-making that has a
              legal or otherwise significant effect using customer data.
